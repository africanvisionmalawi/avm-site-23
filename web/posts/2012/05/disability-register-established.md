We now have a disability register!

Beth Sheehan is a volunteer who came to Malawi two years ago and is a physiotherapist from Australia. She is putting together a disability register for us, so we can try to make referrals to help support this **most vulnerable group**in our area. This will feed into the disability strategy we have which we will start to deliver as soon as we have funds, capacity/capability, and resource.

Last week (May 2012) we were out in the field and met Kondwani (see photo below) a 10 year old boy with Cerebral Palsy, who is cared for by his 12 year old sister; who is obviously not able to go to school.  Kondwani cannot walk, talk, sit and has problems eating and toileting.  If he needs to be taken anywhere, he is put on someone’s back!

We can make a referral to an organisation in Lilongwe who will do a full assessment of his needs, which will include advise on physio and a wheelchair suitable to keep him in a sitting position, with head support.  For that to happen we need to pay for his transport to Lilongwe, supply him with some basics like soap, bowl, mug, etc. to have in hospital, where he will be provided with food, and then pay for transport home and for a wheelchair.  All that can be life changing for him and his family and cost approximately £300.
