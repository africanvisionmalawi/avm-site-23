The Landirani Trust are supporting single women headed families to grow fair-trade groundnuts. These nuts then get sold as ‘Harry’s Nuts’ with the patron being Harry Hill. We are supporting 100 women farmers to move from growing tobacco to growing groundnuts and ensuring that they will get a guaranteed fair-trade price. Please see report link for more information and pictures at [Groundnut Project October 2012](https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/avm-wp-uploads/2012/11/Groundnut-Project-October-2012.docx).
