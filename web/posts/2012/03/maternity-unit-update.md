Monday 19th March 2012 - The refurbished maternity unit at M'bangombe finally got beds moved in and will start to operate this week.  Unfortunately there is no bedding or mosquito nets and very little equipment.  Epsom College have kindly offered some bedding which will be taken over to Malawi in May.
