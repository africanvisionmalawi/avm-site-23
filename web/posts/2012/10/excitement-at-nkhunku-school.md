Heather Palmer went to visit Nkhunku school on Thursday 18th Oct 2012 with gifts from our supporters of a football, exercise books, pens, pencils, rulers, sharpeners and registration books...the excitement was unbelievable.  There were so many screams as they were presented.

(Many thanks to Toni and Derek for their kind contributions)
