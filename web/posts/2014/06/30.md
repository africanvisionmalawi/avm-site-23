Message of thanks from Heather Palmer;

"Hi All

Thanks so much for all your help last Friday, it couldn’t have been successful without you all.  We made £776 on the night from ticket sales, bar and raffle, with a further £350 on pre-sold tickets, making £1126.00.  Take off £75.84 spent on drinks and we made a total of **£1,050.16** in total!  Amazing for 53 ticket holders plus volunteers."

The event; there was a night of performance to celebrate 50 years of Malawian Independence and to raise funds for African Vision Malawi on 4th July, 7pm - 10pm

It was an evening of entertainment with Malawian signers, a Malawian dancer, dance and drama from Kingston College with Malawian influences and telling stories of some of our orphans, along with some short films about the charity.

Proceeds will be going to support disability and a short film will be shown on the night.
