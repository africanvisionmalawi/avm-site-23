One of our fantastic supporters, Paul Alderson from Surbiton, has just completed an amazing 3,500km in The Transcontinental race from London to Istanbul in August. This is a non-stop unsupported race. He did this after shattering his femur in a cycling accident in 2012 and now pins are holding his bones together; this left him off his bike for a whole year!  He has decided to do this amazing challenge to support our Disability Project, knowing first-hand what it is like to be unable to do many things while he was healing.  He still has pain, so this incredible challenge is even more of a success story!

Please support him by making a donation at; [https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/transcontinental2014](https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/transcontinental2014)

Paul's blog post is also available via our 'Upcoming Events' page under the 'Get Involved' tab.
