Heather Palmer went to visit M’dozi Village in Mundundu Centre which is about 60km from the capital city last September.  She spoke to a number of people in the village, namely orphans, single mothers and elderly.

Heather chose to present some blankets, knitted by supporter from All Saints Church, Kingston, to the elderly and clothing to orphans.  Below are some of the blankets that were distributed to elderly...as they no longer have children to look after them as they have passed away due to HIV or malaria.
