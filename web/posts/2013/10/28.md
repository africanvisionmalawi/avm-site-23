Sarah Bowen has just completed her ‘around the coast in 80 days’ cycle trip in mid October 2013, an amazing 4,000km, to raise funds for our Training Village in rural Malawi.   So far she has raised an amazing £17,000 which will build a workshop and some trainee accommodation, particularly focused on disability needs.

If you would like to support her, and us, please go to [https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/sarahbowen](https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/sarahbowen) . Well done Sarah!
