Sadly Sam Hayes passed away tragically on September 10<sup>th</sup> 2013 at the age of 23 and his parents have decided to create a legacy that makes a positive change. His parents will support the building of the Landirani Training Village over the next 3 years and it will become known as **‘Sam’s Village’**.  Sam's friend and family have undertaken to raise the £250,000 to complete and open this amazing project within the next three years. Two mulberry trees  have been planted at the main entrance to the Training Village in dedication to his memory.

Please see visit their web site at [https://www.samsvillage.com/](https://www.samsvillage.com/) where you can find more information or make a donation to this great project.

Our condolences are with Sam's family at this sad time.
