Heather collected two young men who were successful at interview to do a two week Librarian Training course.  They start their training  at The National Library on Monday 23rd Sept 2013.  They are both very excited about this opportunity.  Once trained they will part share the role of Librarian at the new Library & Resource Centre which has been funded between Tolworth Girls School and a grant from De la Rue Charitable Foundation.  Innocent Chimkukuzi (who was one of our former students we sponsored through our Secondary School Programme) and Andrew Longwe are the ones selected.  Both are from the local community and we wish them luck in their new career!
