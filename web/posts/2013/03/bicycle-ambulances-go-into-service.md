Earlier this month (March), the installation and training for some of the new bicycle ambulances was done in two of our centres at Lumbadzi and Mlumbwira.  Fixon Phiri delivered the training and the community are very excited to have such a wonderful life saving resource at their fingertips.

Further installations are planned, so no doubt there will be more photos in due course.

Many thanks for all your support and donations in making this life saving facility possible.
