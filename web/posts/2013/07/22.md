The Tour de France may have finished but Sarah Bowen has started her mega 4,000 km cycle ride around the coast of England and Wales for African Vision Malawi. She started on Thursday 18th July and funds raised will go to our project on the Landirani Training Village and specifically towards disability. If you want to support her and us, please go to [https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/sarahbowen](https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmydonate.bt.com%2Ffundraisers%2Fsarahbowen&h=7AQGQEIio&s=1) . Good luck Sarah!

Keep up to date with Sarah's progress ... please visit her blog and encourage her with some comments and mention it to people to financially support her, even a couple of pounds will make a difference!
