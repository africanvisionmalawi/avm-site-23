**Water and Sanitation**

- Three deep wells with Afrodev pumps and washing areas have been installed as part of a partnership between Landirani Trust and The Rotary Club of Lilongwe.  These are at Msatayani, Chinyama 2 and Chipasula – all in TA M’bang’ombe.  A reciprocal funding application to Rotary International has now been approved, and there is therefore funding for 18 more such facilities which will be installed over the next 6 months.  The location of these wells will be based on Landirani’s own needs assessment, showing villages currently using shallow wells and the number of families in these villages.
- The remaining eight water harvesters have been installed in schools, making a total of 12 harvesters.
- The four shallow wells which had previously been protected by Landirani have now been fitted with Rope Pumps by DAPP following the successful sourcing of the necessary parts.
