Sponsor a knitted square or bauble in the name of someone you love (or in memory of one you love).  A tree at the front of All Saints Church, Kingston will be covered with your knitted decorations making a colourful celebration of love and life! See the posters below for more details of how you can join in. The Tree Decorations will start going up on Friday 18th November in time for the 'Christmas Turning on the Lights' on Saturday 19th November.
