We are so pleased to be nearing the £15,000 target we set ourselves for A Child Is Born, our campaign to build a Waiting Home at the M'bang'ombe maternity unit.

As of today we have raised **£13,940** !

In addition, a kind donor has agreed to match-fund all donations up to the £15,000 target, so that figure is actually worth £27,880 to the expectant mothers and unborn children of our focus area.

Can you donate to bring us up to the target we need to meet?

The rate of premature births in Malawi is a global high of 18.1% and this has a massive knock-on effect to the mortality rate of Under 5's.  Our Waiting Home will provide beds for mothers just before they go into labour, nutritional advice and medical advice.
