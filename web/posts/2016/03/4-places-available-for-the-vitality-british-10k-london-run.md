We have 4 places available for the [Vitality British 10k London Run](https://www.thebritish10klondon.co.uk/) on Sunday 10th July!

Would you like to take on a challenge and raise money for a good cause at the same time?

The places are free to anyone who thinks they can raise at least £300.  We would love to find 4 more people to fundraise in this way to support our projects with orphans, ultra poor people, disabled people and HIV+ people in rural Malawi.

So why delay?  Email us at [info@africanvision.org.uk](mailto:info@africanvision.org.uk) today and put yourself forward!

What do you have to lose?!  [Email us](mailto:info@africanvision.org.uk) and take a look at the [race information here](https://www.thebritish10klondon.co.uk/15/race-information).
