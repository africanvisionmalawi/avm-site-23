Thank you so much to Jono McCleery, Cate and Adam (Afterspark) and Gareth, Mike, Grant, Simon and Matt (Mountain Firework Company) who all played for us at the Grey Horse on Friday. It was a brilliant evening of amazing music and we raised Â£340 - all of which goes directly to the orphans.

Also, thank you to everyone who helped organise the night, matt kelly for organising the wupadupa side of things and for doing the sound and general lovliness, and everyone who was there on the night with their smiles, support, help and cakes!
