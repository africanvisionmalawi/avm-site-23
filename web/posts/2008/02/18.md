We had an exhibition on Friday with photographs by Gaynor Cook. The exhibition, entitled "Life in Malawi", was a collection of photographs taken in Malawi last year (April and October) and showed a variety of aspects of Malawian living and activities. We also showed the DVD by Sam Palmer that we're producing. It's still a work in progress. It's in it's edited state, but with no sound track yet. We had African music playing throughout and a lot of the group who went out in April last year were there so we had lots of people to talk to the guests and give their personal experiences

It was a lovely evening and we raised over Â£1000, mainly due to the sale of 8 of Gaynor's beautiful photos.

A big thank you to all involved, all who came to help us and to everyone who came to support us.

Zikomo Kwambiri...
