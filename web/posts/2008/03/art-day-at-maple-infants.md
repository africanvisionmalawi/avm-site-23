We had a brilliant day with kids aged 4 - 10. There were a number of different activities and everyone had a wicked day. We raised over Â£200.

Big thank you to Jodi, Naomi, Sophie, Shirley, Louise, Ros, Poppy, Kira, Gaynor, Heather, Gill and Yesl for giving up their time and making it run so smoothly; and to all the kids who came and made it the beautiful day it was.
