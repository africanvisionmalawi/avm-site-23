We are so grateful to The Heathland School for their kind donation. We took the bibs to Malawi with us last week and gave them to the kids.

They were so happy and it made such a difference to them because it made them feel special and gives them a sense of worth and you can see how proud they are when they're wearing them!

Thank you so much to everyone!
