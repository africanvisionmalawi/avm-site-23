<span style="">On Friday 4th July The Landirani Trust, along with 23 schools and colleges from Surrey, attempted to set the Guinness World Record for "the largest footprint made from children's footprints". The message was to help the children of Malawi walk out of poverty as well as reducing our carbon footprints here in the UK as all money raised is going on our reforestation project.</span>

The day was a huge success with a great atmosphere created by the girls and teachers at Tolworth Girls, who we'd like to say a huge thank you to. Also thank you to all involved in organising and running the event, to Ed Davey MP who came to officiate the BIGFOOT and the Mayor of Kingston too. And finally to everyone who came down on the day to support us and see the BIGFOOT.</span>

It was a brilliant day but, as Ed Davey pointed out in his very poignant speech, a day with a very important message</span>

<span style="">When we were in Malawi in April we did the footprints of the children in the schools we support over there. 
These footprints were the outline for the BIGFOOT. </span>
