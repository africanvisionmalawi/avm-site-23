Mteza school has been partnered with a UK School.

Fifteen students sat our scholarship entrance exams and eleven new students are being sponsored by Landirani to go to District or National Schools. Landirani is now sponsoring 34 students to go to secondary school.

Three previously sponsored scholarship students have been selected for university: one in teaching, on in engineering and one in nursing.

Three communities were trained in the DSWO's programme for early childhood development and are now running preschools in these three areas.

Four preschools have been trained to use rocket stoves for the feeding programmes (DSWO provided 7 rocket stoves in total)

Feed the Children provide food for the feeding programmes in our area.
