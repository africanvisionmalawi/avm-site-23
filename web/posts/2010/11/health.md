Three bicycle ambulances have been given to communities in our area and the communities were trained in the maintenance and record keeping for the bicycle ambulances. They are proving extremely useful - all the communities have used them several times and they really are saving lives.

Sad news from M'bang'ombe: The maternity Clinic has been closed due to poor repair and awful facilities. We are working with the relevant authorities to try to arrange for the refurbishment of the unit and attached housing to re-open as soon as possible and hopefully encourage more nurses to the area.
