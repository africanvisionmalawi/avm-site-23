Our best Summer Indulgence to date!

The sun was shining and everyone was smiling - especially after receiving a massage, nail therapy, reflexology or nutritional advice from our team of amazing therapists.

There was beautiful homemade food all day and the amazing Little Sister Blue provided the sound track of magic.

Raising Â£1500 was the best amount we've raised to date from one of our indulgence days (now in it's third year) and we aim to increase the amount next year with more therapists and magic to entice you round...

The money raised this year will go towards health and nutrition in Malawi - providing mosquito nets, setting up feeding centres and providing safe water to our area.

Thank you so much to everyone who came and everyone who helped out, and massive thanks to all the therapists who gave up their time and expertise for free.
