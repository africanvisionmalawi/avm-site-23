In September 2010 Sam and Rob will be cycling all the way to Morocco to raise money for bicycles in Malawi that save lives.

Many people in the rural parts of Malawi that we support don't have the means to get to the local clinics to receive the treatment they desparately need. When a lady is in labour she is often carried on the back of an ox-driven cart, or doesn't make it to hospital at all. The carts used in these situations are too slow and cause complications or fatalities. Similarly, in the case of medical emergencies, accidents or illness, the villagers don't have the necessary transport to get them to the clinic quick enough and situations that could easily be resolved by doctors end up worsening, or ending in fatality.

We are introducing bicycle ambulances into our area and we know this will make a huge difference to those in our area.

These bicycles have a stretcher attached to the back, that is safe and secure. It also has a sun/rain shield for the patient.

Sam and Rob will be riding over 2000km to Morocco to raise funds and awareness for this life-protecting project.
