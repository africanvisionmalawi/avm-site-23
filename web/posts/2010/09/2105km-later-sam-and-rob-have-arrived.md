Having left Surbiton on Saturday 5th September, the boys have cycled 2,105km (1,308 miles) and arrived in Morocco, Africa.

Traveling between 90km and 150km a day, they cycled all the way, with only one day off!

Beautiful scenery, pain, bike troubles and almost being robbed all contributed to this phenominal journey by two amazing guys!

We will be posting a first hand account from Sam and Rob as soon as they get back.

Sam and Rob have undergone this HUGE journey to raise money for bicycle ambulances.
