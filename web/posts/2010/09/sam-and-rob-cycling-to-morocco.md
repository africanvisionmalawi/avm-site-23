Sam and Rob left Surbiton on Sunday 5th September at 8.30am to cycle all the way to Morocco and they are averaging between 90km and 120km a day.

[To follow their journey please click here](/news/2010-09-09/81/)

The boys are raising money and awareness for bicycle ambulances in our area in Malawi, literally saving lives with every penny they raise.

[For more information on bicycle ambulances click here](/projects/#project-14)

To sponsor the boys please click the "Paypal donate to Landirani" button on the right of this page and write "Bike ride" in the purpose box. Please give generously as it costs around £400 to put in a new bicycle ambulance and training and these really do save lives.
