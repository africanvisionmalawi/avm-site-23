Between June and August 2010 we have distributed 570 blankets, 500 sleeping mats and 1,100 items of warm clothing.

250 of the blankets came from Gift of the Givers who also donated over 500 jumpers and jackets which we have distributed to orphans and vulnerable children at all 13 of our centres. Some elderly people also benefitted from the blankets and clothes to keep them warm during the winter.

150 of the blankets were donated by The Rotary Club of Lilongwe in August

The remaining blankets and clothes were from our own supplies.

This is a fantastic achievement and we are sending a huge thank you to Gift of the Givers, The Rotary, Lilongwe and our team in Malawi who have worked so hard securing the donations and ensuring the distributions have been successful.
