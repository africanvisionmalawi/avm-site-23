It only costs £100 to build up a well to make it safe a free from contamination. This is a great christmas present for your friends and family as it is genuinely saving lives and we will have a plaque created with the name of your recipient on it to go on the well - we will then take pictures of the well upon completion and send it to them.

You can also buy a share in a well by paying £50 and having your name on the well with someone else.

If you would like to take this unique opportunity to make a substantial difference to the lives of those in Malawi please visit our shop (tab at the top of the homepage) and click on "Build up a well", which costs £100\. Once you have placed your order we will send you the form to fill out the details of your recipient that you would like put on the plaque.

The chart below shows the % of people drinking safe/un safe water in 4 of the areas in which we have carried out Needs Assessments. It gives you a quick insight into the huge problem we are facing.
