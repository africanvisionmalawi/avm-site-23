Landirani Live was a fantastic day of music, magic and art. There were so many beautiful experiences from stilt walkers, to music from artists such as little sister blue, Carrie Tree and Martha Tilston, to face painting and hairbraiding or event joining in to make a giant multi-coloured crocodile out of recycled materials!

It really was very special and beautiful.

Thank you so much to everyone who came and all the amazing volunteers/artists who gave so much time and magic free!
