31 Upper Brighton road played host to the most successful Indulgence day yet. The third of this type of event had new therapies, sunshine, pimms and relaxing magic throughout the day.

Thank you so much to everyone who came, and especially to Nerys, Lisa and Jo for giving their time, talents, skills and dedication for free.

Everyone had such a fantastic time and we raised Â£1048.80 for the new Landirani Box Library. This library will be a mobile library that lends books (donated by schools in the UK) to our schools in Malawi on rotation.

Zikomo kwambiri (thank you very much) to everyone involved in making the event such a huge success.
