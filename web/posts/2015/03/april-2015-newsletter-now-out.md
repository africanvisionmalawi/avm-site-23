The latest African Vision newsletter is out. You can read it here ...  [April 2015 Newsletter](https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/avm-wp-uploads/2015/03/April-AVM-Newsletter-2015.pdf "April 2015 Newsletter")

This year is our 10th Anniversary and there is lots going on to celebrate, including our [Hampton Court Flower Show Garden](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/get-involved/garden/ "Hampton Court Flower Show 2015 Garden") in July.

There is a full update on the very exciting progress being made in Sam's Village which I hope you will enjoy. I do hope many of you will be able to join us on [Tuesday April 14th](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/event/gala-evening-to-mark-10-years/ "Gala Evening to mark 10 years…") at the cornerHOUSE, Surbiton for the gala night celebrating our journey over 10 years, through photography and artwork.

Nigel will be in Malawi with the team there for most of April and will report back on the progress shortly afterwards.
