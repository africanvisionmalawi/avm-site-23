You will no doubt have heard we won Gold at the [Hampton Court Flower Show Garden](https://www.africanvision.org.uk/get-involved/garden/ "Hampton Court Flower Show 2015 Garden") in July this year. Click the link above for more information.

I do hope many of you will be able to join us on Tuesday 10th November at the cornerHOUSE, Surbiton for a gala evening where you can buy Calendars and Christmas Cards designed by the Graphic Design students at Kingston College and Christmas presents.

Heather will be in Malawi with the team there in September and many of the trustees will be there in October too. A progress report will follow shortly afterwards.
